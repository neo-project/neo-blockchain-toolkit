## Key Benefits

- **Out-of-the-box** : Premium experience with preconfigured toolkit to jump start
  the development of Smart Contracts
- **One-stop-shop** : Proven libraries and practices to rapidly get Smart Contracts
  into production
- **One-IDE** : Built-in real world PrivateNet with frictionless
  edit-build-debug-deployment enhancements to ensure consistency across PrivateNet,
  TestNet and MainNet
- **N3 Preview Support**: Supports [Neo N3 and Neo Legacy](https://medium.com/neo-smart-economy/introducing-neo-n3-the-next-evolution-of-the-neo-blockchain-b2960c4def6e)

## Getting Started

Please see the [N3 Tutorials](https://developers.neo.org/tutorials/2021/05/27/getting-started-with-the-neo-blockchain-toolkit) site for quick start
videos and real world tutorials on using the latest version of the Neo Blockchain Toolkit.

For developers targeting Neo Legacy, please see the [Neo Blockchain Toolkit Quickstart](https://github.com/neo-project/neo-blockchain-toolkit/blob/master/quickstart.md)
for instructions on setting up the tools and creating your first Neo Legacy smart contract.

## Key Components

### Neo Smart Contract Debugger

- Fully integrated Smart Contract debugging experience inside of Visual Studio Code

### Neo Express

- Real-world PrivateNet - enabling complete end-to-end scenarios for Neo 2.x and
  Neo 3.0, built on top of the Neo MainNet codebase
- Manage Neo Express for multiple nodes and multiple developers from within Visual
  Studio Code or using command-line utilities
- Enhanced operations for developer scenarios. e.g. Snapshot/Rollback/FastForward/Replay etc.

### Neo Visual DevTracker

- Explore public and private Neo blockchains from within Visual Studio Code
- Transfer assets, claim GAS, deploy and invoke smart contracts on public and
  private Neo blockchains from withing Visual Studio Code
- Create and manage Neo Express instances from within Visual Studio Code

### NEON Smart Contract Compiler

- Enhanced Compiler with metadata to map .NET source code to NeoVM byte code and
  function variables/arguments information etc.
- Create, Edit, Compile, Debug, Test, and Deploy Smart Contracts on both Neo 2.x
  and Neo 3.0 from within Visual Studio Code

### Smart Contract Templates in .NET languages

- Friction-free templates and guidance for developer productivity
- Real-World production quality Smart Contract Development in minutes

### Neo-FX Library

- Unified Programming Model for a consistent and highly productive developer
  experience spanning remote, node and contract SDKs.
- Neo-FX will provide a common set of fundamental types (such as large unsigned
  integers for hash values and elliptic curves for cryptography), domain models
  (such as blocks and transactions) and service abstractions (such as retrieving
  a transaction or invoking a smart contract).
- By using these common set of types across SDKs, developers will be able to move
  their code between SDKs, ensuring they can run their code in the manner that
  makes most sense for their blockchain application.
